Document Parser and RAG Pipeline Overview

Introduction
This document describes a comprehensive document parsing and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline designed for intelligent document analysis and question-answering systems.

Key Components
The pipeline consists of several integrated components:

1. Document Processing
The document processor handles multiple file formats including PDF, DOCX, and plain text files. It extracts text content and prepares it for further processing through intelligent chunking strategies.

2. Text Chunking
Text is divided into manageable chunks using sentence-based segmentation with configurable overlap to maintain context continuity. Each chunk is optimized for embedding generation and retrieval.

3. Embedding Generation
The system uses the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 sentence transformer model to generate high-quality vector embeddings. This model provides excellent performance for semantic similarity tasks while maintaining computational efficiency.

4. Vector Storage
LanceDB serves as the vector database, providing fast similarity search capabilities. The database stores both the text chunks and their corresponding embeddings with comprehensive metadata.

5. Chat Interface
A LangChain-powered conversational interface enables natural language interactions with the stored documents. The system provides contextual responses with proper source citations.

Technical Architecture
The application is built using modern Python libraries and frameworks:
- Sentence Transformers for embeddings
- LanceDB for vector storage
- LangChain for chat functionality
- Streamlit for the web interface

Use Cases
This pipeline is ideal for:
- Research document analysis
- Knowledge base querying
- Educational content exploration
- Technical documentation search

Conclusion
The document parser and RAG pipeline provides a robust foundation for building intelligent document analysis applications with natural language interfaces.
